// mag (Integer: this source's  ID)
// openalex (String: this source's . Same as )
// wikidata (String: this source's  ID)

// is_oa
// Boolean: Whether this is currently fully-open-access source. This could be true for a preprint repository where everything uploaded is free to read, or for a  or  open access journal, where all newly published Works are available for free under an open license.
// We say "currently" because the status of a source can change over time. It's common for journals to "flip" to Gold OA, after which they may make only future articles open or also open their back catalogs. It's entirely possible for a source to say is_oa: true, but for an article from last year to require a subscription.
// is_oa: true
// issn
// List: The  used by this source. Many publications have multiple ISSNs (), so  should be used when possible.

// String: The  identifying this source. This is the  for sources.
// ISSN is a global and unique ID for serial publications. However, different media versions of a given publication (e.g., print and electronic) often have different ISSNs. This is why we can't have nice things. The ISSN-L or Linking ISSN solves the problem by designating a single canonical ISSN for all media versions of the title. It's usually the same as the print ISSN.
